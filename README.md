# PythonProjects
A Wide Range of Python Projects, from an interactive map quiz of Africa, to a bouncing ball with random physics, to a key signature identifier with Librosa's Chromagrams


## For Africa.py

pip install geopandas

pip install matplotlib

pip install shapely

pip install cartopy



For Quantum Projects

pip install qiskit


For Falling Sand or Bouncing Ball

pip install pygame


For Key Signature Identifier

pip install librosa

pip install sys

pip install numpy



# Africa.py

Interactive Map Quiz of Africa. To use, edit line 22 of Africa.py to plug in the absolute filepath of Africa.shp. 

# Key Signature identifier

Creates a chromagram out of the wav file using Librosa. Then, identifies the key signature based on known values for key signature profiles.
To run, simply use

python keySignature.py [Path]

# Falling Sand

Falling sand game, where size of cursor can be changed by scrolling up/down. Different types of materials, such as sand, lava, water, and stone

# Bouncing Ball
